# 📡 Telecommunication Systems Project

## 📖 Overview
This project explores **high-order constellations** in digital communication systems, focusing on achieving high-speed data transmission and energy efficiency. Using the **Hexagonal Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (HQAM)** scheme, the project aims to address challenges in detection algorithms for next-generation telecommunication systems (6G and beyond).

## 🎯 Goals
- **🚀 High-Order Constellations**: Investigate HQAM constellations to enhance data rate and energy efficiency.
- **🛠️ Algorithm Development**: Propose a novel symbol detection algorithm utilizing dynamic circle radii.
- **📊 Performance Analysis**: Simulate the Symbol Error Probability (SEP) of HQAM constellations and compare with existing methods.

## ✨ Features
### 🧪 Simulation and Analysis
- **📈 HQAM Symbol Error Probability (SEP)**:
  - Simulated SEP for constellations of size M = [16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024].
  - Comparison with existing methods to validate accuracy.
- **📐 Upper Bound Approximation**:
  - Visualization of the upper bounds for SEP under different configurations.

### 🤖 Proposed Detection Algorithm
- **Dynamic Circle Detection**:
  - Utilizes circles of varying radii centered on received symbols for efficient detection.
  - Reduces the computational complexity compared to Maximum Likelihood Detection (MLD).
- **Database of Optimal Radii**:
  - Precomputed for specific system parameters (e.g., SNR, dmin) to enhance detection efficiency.
